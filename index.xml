      <description>Full disclosure: I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Codes of Conduct (CoCs), but if anything, this post favors the other side of the debate. Community concensus is a personal and professional interest of mine1, so I found myself compelled to really understand what was driving the conflict around CoCs. Every time a project considers adopting or changing their code of conduct, the project&amp;rsquo;s community has a discussion about about the change. The thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed about these discussions is that they are never about the project itself.</description>
